# DisneyNLP
This project is on analyzing customer sentiment regarding attractions at three Disneyland locations (Anaheim, Paris, and Hong Kong) using sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and n-gram associations. We also identified important keywords using topic modeling that can help Disney determine visitor pain points and improve park experience.
